    "Writing papers is a necessary part of life of any researcher. When a scientist makes a discovery or simply gets an interesting result, the first order of business is to publish it. By pubishing  the results of your work you establish its ownership, inform the scientific community of the new findings and receive feedback, which is very important in defining the direction of new research projects. If not properly pubilicised, the result of your research cannot be used in proposals for further research funding or as an argument in scientific dispute. Without a solid publication you simple can't take a full credit for it and your also should be prepared to see your result reported and claimed by somebody else. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An article submitted to a refereed journal passes a review process. The journal editor sends the paper to a an expert scientist in your research field for evaluation. Based on the reviewer recommendations the editor can accept the publication, to reject the paper, or, most commonly,  to recommend corrections to your work before the publishing the work. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the \"The Astrophysical Journal\" and \"Astronomy & Astrophysics\" are refereed journals. The most common example of non-referred publication is a  conference proceedings. In conference processings scientists usually report intermediate results of an ongoing research. This kind of publications carry much less impact. Refereed journals also differ in terms of importance, thus the journal impact factor ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor)).\n",
    " \n",
    "Publication in a refereed journal is a qualitiy stamp from the community of your peers. However, usually it is a tedious and lengthy process. Can there be some way to make it easier?  A seasoned scientist usually knows in advance, which journal he plans to submit his new article to based on his past experience. For a young reseacher it can be confusing to choose the journal. As part of my experimentaion with NLP analysis, I decided in investigate wheather it is possible to infer the journal where the paper was published based on the text of its abstract. As side product, it can serve as a way to recommend the journal for submission. When submitted to a right journal, a lot of time and energy can be saved by going through an easier and faster review process.\n"

    "Our goal is to create a classification model, which predicts the journal using the text of abstract. Generally, a classifier takes a set of numerical features of a certain length and  corresponding labels, and creates a model by optimizing a set of parameters. However, an abstract is a collection of words of an arbitrary length. To transform a text object into a numerical vector I create a pipeline consisting of several standard NLP processing steps:\n",

    "* Turn the journal names to numerical labels\n",

    "* Putting the words into lowecase\n",

    "* Lemmatizing, i.e. putting the words into their basic form by removing plural, ending, etc.\n",
    "* Apply [N-Gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) model by keeping 1-gram and 2-grams sequences\n",
    "* Apply term frequency–inverse document frequency ([TDIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf)) statistic to vectorize the data\n",

    "The overall presision is 67%. In other words, the model correctly predicts journals for two out of three abstracts. While this may appear not very impressive, I think it is not actually that bad. We are trying to predict one from seventeen categories based on very complex and noisy data. For me as a human, even though former astronomer, it would be a challenging task to guess the publishing journal at this accuracy. There is no direct reason for the abstracts in ,for example, \"The Astrophysical Journal\" to be too much different from those published in \"Astronomy & Astrophysics\". However, the model have found the way to do a good job by figuring out features, which reflects such subtile aspects as editing styles, possible differences in terminology, regional differences, etc.\n"

Also, the \"Classical and Quantum Gravity\" and \"Physical Review D\" may present a small group related to general physics. The prediction for a journal in a group with high probability falls into the same group. This shows that the model does distinguish between texts which belong to different subdivisions of natural sciences.\n",

For some journals we even have zero precision, like \"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters\".

This may be fixed by balancing the training set or class weighting during the model fit.\n"
